# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club Project Details - Lending Club is an important marketplace for borrowers and lenders. Lending money without appropriate caution has been a reason for losses in the past. In this project, I have attempted to use Python specifically Pandas to identify potential defaulters in hope of creating a safer and more positive marketplace experience for both lenders and geniune borrowers.

## General Information
- This project is part of my learning Data Science. There is no non disclosure agreement required and the project does not contain any sensitive information. The project shows the data analysis and modelling skills I have been able to learn.
- Lending club is a marketplace for lenders and borrowers. This project is aimed to help predict if a borrower will default on the loan based on the previous patterns followed by defaulters. The model is intended to be used as a reference tool for the lenders to help make decisions on issuinng loans, so that the risks can be lowered, and the profit can be maximised. 
- The dataset comes as an Excel File consisting of 39717 rows and 111 columns. It is nicely formatted in tabular forms. However, a variety of problems did exist in the dataset, so it requires extensive data cleaning before any analysis can be made.

## Conclusions
- Small businesses are more likely to default on their loans.
- Lower income groups (0 - 20000) are more likely to default on their loans
- Clients with employment rate less than 1 year and more than 10 years are more likely to take a default on their loans
- State of Nebraska has the greatest ratio of defaulted loans
- Clients with customer rating A are the least likely to default while the ones with credt rating G are most likely to default
- Clients with two or mor Public record Bankruptcies are more likely to default
- Loans with interest rate 10-13% run a higher risk of defaults
